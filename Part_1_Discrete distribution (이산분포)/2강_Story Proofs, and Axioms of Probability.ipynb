Don't lose common sense \n","```\n","That doesn't mean you can rely only on common sense, because we're going to see over and over again in this course a lot of couterintuitive results that may seem to defy common sense. But that doesn't mean -- just because we're doing some counterintuitive stuff sometimes doesn't mean you should abandon common sense. \n","And I also mean this not only in terms of do your answers makes sense, but also just in terms of being reasonable. (ex. you don't need to calculate all the process)\n","```\n","<br>\n","2. Do check answers    \n","(esp. by doing simple and extreme cases)\n","```\n","just briefly, checking answers does not mean go through and look what you did and say that looks OK, like do the same thing twice. \n","Checking answer means trying special cases, things like that, thinking of another approach. A lot of problems can be solved in more than one method, and if you get the same answer, you're happy. If you get a different answer, then you have to think harder and you learn something from that. \n","```\n","```\n","So the best advice for this is, especially, by doing simple and extreme cases. \n","Like you might have a problem that you have some answer in terms of n, and k, and q. And if you plug in n equals 1 and it's completely obviously wrong, then that's useful information, right? But most students don't bother to just pluf in n equals 1 and see if it makes sense.\n","```\n","<br>\n","3. Label    : give some ID  \n","(to people, object, and ets...) / (If have n people, then label them 1, 2, 3, ..., n)\n","```\n","All I mean by this is just, if the problem will just say 'we have n people ~~' then assume that they're labled with the numbers 1 up to n. Very very simple, but that's extremely useful. \n","Just think of this as an ID number, or social security number, or whatever. You can do that to any obejects, and you can choose your any own notation.\n","```\n","```\n","People start to get confused when we talk about like balls. And the question is are they indistinguishable or distinguishable, and whatever. \n","So suppose you have 10 green balls in a jar and they all look completely identical to you. They may look comletely identical to you, but the point is that, as far as probability is concerned, as far as nature is conserned, it behaves as if they are dinstinguishable and labled. And that's going to give you the correct answers. \n","Whereas, if you just say, \"well, they're completely identical, so they're indistinguishable.\", then you'll run into trouble.\n","```\n","<br>\n","\n","[08:20 ~ 11:20] <br><br>\n","\n","distinguishability (ID) and justification for naive definition (equally likely) <br><br>\n","\n","#### Subtle issue of distinguishability on counting order (or ID) <br>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RVC0GPuQwTq9","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]}]}
