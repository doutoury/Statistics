    "```\n",
    "Do anything -- as long as there are certain possible outcomes.  \n",
    "So before the experiment, you don't know what's going to happen,  \n",
    "because there are different possible outcomes you don't know which one's going to happen.\n",
    "you do the experiment and then something happens.\n",

    "One of the big breakthrough in probability that made it possible to actually treat this as a mathematical subject instead of just something intuitive was the idea of using sets. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "mathematically-speaking, an event is subset of sample space in terms of set theory. <br>\n",

    "- Many problems in probability are counter-intuitive <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "That was a huge breakthrough, becuase before people just kind of tried to like solve probability problems by just kind of writing down some stuff that sounded intuitive, or reasoning by analogy and various heuristics. Most of those heuristics unfortunately turned out to be completely wrong.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "look at the handout on the website later about probability and sets.\n",
    "the purpose is to connect intuitive ideas about events and make that mathematically precise using unions, intersections, complements(여집합) and things like that.\n",

    "We're imagining we have some experiment that we're considering, we have the sample space, we have a subset we're interested in, A. Because we want to know what's 'the chance', what are 'the odds' that some particular event will occur. That's the question we're going to be considering throughout this course.\n",
